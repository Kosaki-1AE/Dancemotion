## Description

✅ **1. Map Body Postures to Emotions**

| Emotion | Movement/Posture Characteristics |
| --- | --- |
| **Sadness** | Curved spine, downward gaze, hunched torso, inward arms |
| **Joy** | Open arms, extended chest, upward gaze, high energy |
| **Fear** | Contracted limbs, sudden directional changes, guarded torso |
| **Anger** | Strong, sharp, rigid movements, tension in shoulders |
| **Love** | Fluid, embracing gestures, soft arm arcs, chest openness |
| **Surprise** | Quick head turns, hands near face, raised shoulders |

You can identify these by checking:

- Angle between joints (e.g., elbow, knee)
- Distance between keypoints (e.g., wrist and shoulder)
- Torso tilt direction and amplitude

✅ **2. Sequence Analysis for Story Prediction**

| Frame | Observed Pose Characteristics | Interpreted Emotion |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Inward chest, bent spine | Sadness |
| 2 | Arms slightly lifted, torso leans forward | Searching/longing |
| 3 | Raised arms, expanded chest | Joy or realization |
| 4–6 | Mixed posture, transitional flow | Emotional conflict |
| 7–9 | Balanced, flowing arm arcs | Acceptance/love |
| 10 | Hands to heart, grounded feet | Peace/resolution |

→ **Story prediction**: A person goes through emotional turmoil, searches for meaning or connection, and finally finds peace or emotional closure.

Combine FaceLandmarker + Pose Detection

1. **Import Libraries**: The code uses OpenCV for image processing, NumPy for numerical operations, and MediaPipe for face and pose detection.
2. **Load FaceLandmarker Model**:
    - A pre-trained face landmark detection model is loaded with options to output facial blendshapes (emotional expressions) and facial transformation matrices for one face.
3. **Initialize Pose Detection Model**:
    - The pose detection model from MediaPipe is initialized, which identifies human body poses.
4. **Setup Drawing Utilities**:
    - Utilities for drawing landmarks on the images are set up.
5. **Camera Setup**:
    - The code initializes the webcam to capture video frames and sets the window size for displaying results.
6. **Processing Loop**:
    - Captures video frames in a loop, converting each frame from BGR to RGB format.
    - Processes the frame to detect body pose landmarks and facial landmarks.
7. **Draw Landmarks**:
    - If pose landmarks are detected, they are drawn on the image.
    - If face landmarks are detected, they are also drawn, along with the face mesh connections.
8. **Display Blendshapes (Emotions)**:
    - The top 5 facial blendshapes (expressions) detected are shown with their confidence scores.
9. **Show Results**:
    - The annotated image (with pose and face landmarks) is displayed in a window. The loop continues until the ESC key is pressed.
10. **Clean Up**:
    - After exiting the loop, the camera is released, and all OpenCV windows are destroyed.

This code effectively combines facial emotion recognition with body pose detection using real-time video input.

Common code structure goals for vision recognition

| Goal | Suggested action |
| --- | --- |
| Modularize logic | Split into modules |
| Easier switching between models | Wrap detection in classes or strategy pattern |
| Run/test components independently | Add main() blocks to each module |
| Log or export data | Use a logger or CSV writer module |
| Plug in emotion classifier | Add [interference.py](http://interference.py) and model loading utilities |
| Threading/ performance boost | Move camera capture to a thread-safe queue. |
